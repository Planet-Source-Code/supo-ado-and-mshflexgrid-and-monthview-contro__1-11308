## ADO and MSHFlexgrid and MonthView contro


</div>

### Description

This code demonstrate how to connect to database (Patients97) using ADO code alone. I also demonstrate using the MonthView control and MSHFlexgrid control. The database called Patients97 contains customer details like name , address, customer number etc and appointment date and time. On the form, I have an MSHFlexgrid control, a MonthView control and a command button(cmdViewAppt). Clicking the command button connects to the database using ADO code and the details are displayed on the MSHFlexgrid control. You can display appointments for a particular date by clicking on a date on the MonthView control (MonthView1_DateClick event) and the result is displayed on the MSHFlexgrid control. I have not figured out how to create a report yet. What I'll like to do is to be able to pull the information on the MSHFlexgrid control and display it as a report which can be viewed and printed.Preferably I'll like to use the data report designer but I won't mind using excel or word or is there a way to use DataEnvironment designer? Please e-mail me any improvements or additions at supo@orimogun.freeserve.co.uk.
